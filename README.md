## Description
This project challenges our newly earned knowledge of MongoDB and Mongoose. This expanded knowledge is similar to what was learned with MySQL. It uses our knowledge of Express.js and Node.js to create a database. Once this database is created, we develop Models, Controllers, and Routes to for CRUD operations to and from the database.
